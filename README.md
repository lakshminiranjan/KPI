**Brief Description (2 lines):**  
This release enhances KPI management by adding two key data fields, advanced filtering for active/inactive KPIs, and per-column dynamic sorting with visual indicators. Users can now manage, filter, and sort KPIs far more flexibly and intuitively.

**Three Main Change Points:**
1. Added "Constraints" and "Subject Matter Expert Email" columns to KPITable, stored procedures, and all related UI and backend code.  
2. Implemented a toggle to filter KPIs by active or inactive status, linked to backend filtering and UI state.  
3. Enabled dynamic per-column sorting (ascending/descending) with clickable arrow buttons and active sort indicators, fully integrated with backend SQL sorting.

To document this enhancements as three major changes in this version 2.0 give like what and changed for each task. First added two new columns naming 'constraints' and 'Subject Matter expert email' which requires changes in Kpi table, insert, update, select all kpi stored proc, in UI aspx, vb code changes and second filtering kpis according to the active field which gives active/inactive according to the toggle implemented and requires changes in Get all kpis stored proc and ui changes in aspx, vb code and third change is that sorting each field by implementing ascending or descending the record by adding a button beside column names. This third task also require changes in get all kpis stored proc and in UI aspx, vb code. After  completing of describing three tasks leave space under documentation for txt files which will have sql queries and aspx, vb files that are need to be changed for deployment

Certainly! Here’s concise and clear release documentation for **v2.0**, organized by the three major enhancements you introduced. Each section lists WHAT was changed, and WHERE (SQL, ASPX, VB.NET), in a technical "change log" style for stakeholders and deployment.

# KPI Management v2.0 – Enhancement Documentation

## 1. **Additional Data Columns:**  
### Added **“Constraints”** and **“Subject Matter Expert Email”** to KPI Data

**What & Where Changed:**
- **Database:**
  - Extended **KPITable** to include two new columns:  
    - `Constraints` (VARCHAR/appropriate type)
    - `Subject_Matter_Expert_Email` (VARCHAR/appropriate type)
- **Stored Procedures:**
  - Updated the following procs to support new fields:
    - **InsertKPI**: Add `@Constraints`, `@Subject_Matter_Expert_Email` input params and insert logic.
    - **UpdateKPIByID**: Add/maintain new fields in update logic and as parameters.
    - **GetAllKPITable**: Add both new columns to SELECT result set.
- **UI ASPX:**
  - Added input fields for both new attributes in the KPI add/edit modal/form:
    - `<asp:TextBox ID="txtConstraints" ... />`
    - `<asp:TextBox ID="txtSMEEmail" ... />`
  - Extended GridView to show *Constraints* and *Subject Matter Expert Email* columns.
- **VB.NET Code:**
  - Updated backend to:
    - Capture/save the new Constraint and SME Email values when adding/editing a KPI.
    - Populate these fields during editing (in `LoadEditData`).
    - Pass them into insert/update SqlDataSource parameters.

## 2. **Filtering KPIs By Active/Inactive Status via Toggle**

**What & Where Changed:**
- **Stored Procedures:**
  - Enhanced **GetAllKPITable** to accept a `@Status` parameter (`'Y'` for active, `'N'` for inactive).
  - Returns only matching records.
- **UI ASPX:**
  - Added a toggle switch above the GridView to select “Active” or “Inactive” KPIs.
  - Bound toggle state to the filtering logic—when toggled, updates the KPI listing.
- **VB.NET Code:**
  - Handles the toggle’s state change event, sets the `@Status` parameter for the data source, and refreshes the GridView accordingly.
  - Ensures the toggle’s state persists and reflects the correct label (“Active”/“Inactive”).

## 3. **Sorting by Any Field – Ascending/Descending Controls**

**What & Where Changed:**
- **Stored Procedures:**
  - Enhanced **GetAllKPITable** to accept `@SortColumn` and `@SortDirection` parameters and use dynamic SQL for ordering by any allowed field and direction.
  - Prevents duplicate ordering on the same column (e.g., when sorting by OrderWithinSecton).
- **UI ASPX:**
  - For each GridView column, added up/down arrow buttons (▲/▼) beside the column name, with hover effect.
  - Configured each button to sort that column in asc/desc order when clicked.
  - Visual indicator highlights the active sort column and direction.
- **VB.NET Code:**
  - Handles sorting commands from GridView (which column/direction), stores state in ViewState.
  - Updates SqlDataSource parameters accordingly and re-binds the grid.
  - Ensures sorting works for all columns, including newly added ones.
  - Renders the arrow for the currently sorted column in the header.

# FILES TO MODIFY / ATTACHMENTS (to be pasted below for deployment)

Give description In 4-5 for this enhancement

**Enhancement Description (in 4-5 lines):**

This version introduces three key improvements to the KPI Management module. First, it adds two new data columns—Constraints and Subject Matter Expert Email—to the KPI record structure and updates all related database operations and user interfaces to support them. Second, it implements an intuitive toggle switch above the grid to filter KPIs based on their active or inactive status, with backend filtering via the status parameter. Third, it enables dynamic sorting for every grid column, allowing users to sort ascending or descending using interactive arrow buttons, with all sorting handled efficiently on the database side for performance. These changes collectively improve data richness, usability, and flexibility for KPI management.

Please give release. Notes for KPI Library version 2.0

Here are the **Release Notes** for **KPI Library version 2.0**:

***

# KPI Library v2.0 – Release Notes

## Overview
KPI Library v2.0 introduces major enhancements for improved data management, user convenience, and reporting flexibility. Three principal improvements have been made: expanded data columns, powerful filtering, and a complete upgrade to grid sorting and usability.

***

## Key Enhancements

### 1. **Expanded KPI Data Columns**
- Two new fields, **Constraints** and **Subject Matter Expert Email**, have been added to KPI records.
- The database table, all relevant stored procedures, UI forms, and grid views have been updated to support these fields.
- Users can add, edit, and view constraint information and SME contact for each KPI.

### 2. **Active/Inactive Filtering**
- UI now includes an **Active/Inactive toggle switch**, allowing quick filter between active and inactive KPIs.
- Backend filtering is optimized; only selected KPIs are queried and displayed.
- The filter state persists on reload, and editing status is seamless.

### 3. **Dynamic Column Sorting**
- Every KPI grid column has clickable up/down arrows to sort values in ascending or descending order.
- The current sort column and direction are visually indicated beside the column header.
- Sorting is performed directly on the server for speed and accuracy.

***

## Other Changes & Fixes
- Improved form validation for new fields.
- Enhanced gridrow editing with robust data population regardless of grid sorting or filtering.
- All updates maintain compatibility across browsers and fit with existing grid styling.
- Bug fix: Sort indicators now appear correctly for all columns, including the "Order" field.

***

## Deployment Notes
- **Database scripts**: ALTER TABLE for new columns; updated stored procedures for insert, update, and selection.
- **UI files**: Updated ASPX (KPI-Library.aspx), code-behind (Kpi-Library.aspx.vb), designer files as necessary.
- **Testing**: Test cases are available for Add/Edit KPI, sorting, filtering, indicator display, and validation.

***

## Known Issues & Compatibility
- No major issues in this release.
- Data migration is required for previous KPIs to populate the new columns, if needed.

***

## Attachments / Files for Deployment
- SQL scripts and modified code files to be referenced in deployment documentation.
- Complete test case matrix for QA is available in Excel format.

***

**This version delivers stronger data control, user interface improvements, and robust reporting features for all KPI management users.**
